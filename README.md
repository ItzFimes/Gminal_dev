### You still here? Well, let me show you around!

Traveller, this is _Gminal!_ Gminal this is the _traveller_ I told you about.
![Gminal not understanding hello](https://github.com/ItzFimes/Gminal_dev/assets/83063145/2f306a46-32e0-4e37-a963-f1b96ce34561)   
Oh, you don't speak the same language? That's <sub>weird</sub>. I thought you _could_ speak in Gminal.  
Well, don't worry, I'm going to teach you. It's not that complicated, so just listen to me, and you should be good to go.

## Talking in Gminal
### 1. Basics
First, I'll show you the basics. So, let's make him list the items in the current directory! Say `dir` !
![dir command](https://github.com/ItzFimes/Gminal_dev/assets/83063145/1272104d-25f1-49ce-b578-b7fb76c68474)  
Great! You did it! Let me show you a few more filesystem commands!  
Use `cd` to change your directory! 
![cd command](https://github.com/ItzFimes/Gminal_dev/assets/83063145/0ec2caf5-9ac3-45a6-8e4a-eaa8467aa97a)  
If you get angry at some directory, use `deldir` to delete a directory.
![deldir command](https://github.com/ItzFimes/Gminal_dev/assets/83063145/07ebc261-d623-4059-8e92-09f39d451b9b) 
To make a directory you can use `mkdir`.
![mkdir command](https://github.com/ItzFimes/Gminal_dev/assets/83063145/15e56603-914d-4c32-a398-989f1136ed9b)
_Hey! Pssst._ _**-in a whispering voice-**_ Come closer. I'm going to tell you a little _secret_, but you will need to promise me that you won't tell anyone. If you want to give Gminal Jesus privileges, just say(type) `su` and press enter.  

Well, it seems like my time is running out, so if you excuse me, I'm gonna go! **If you want to learn more, don't be afraid to use the `help` command!**
