# Dev version of Gminal
## Hey there, traveller! If you are looking for the actual exe, please follow this link: [Official Gminal Repo](https://www.github.com/ItzFimes/Gminal)
## (as of right now the dev version of Gminal(core 2.0) is not officially supported on Python 3.11 and lower. It might work, but I can't guarantee it)

- as of right now gminal is kind of a mess, but I swear I'll fix it soon ><
- Gminal core V2 can only run on linux and I don't plan on making it compatible with windows :3
